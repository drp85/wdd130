            <h2>Music</h2>
            <p>Music is one of the largest shapers of my life. Listening, composing, playing, performing, and mixing are constants in my life.<br>Everyone in my family plays at least one instrument. I am a direct descendent of Parley P. Pratt, who wrote several hymns in the LDS hymnal.</p>

                        I have been a singer my whole life, and I played trombone from 5th grade through high school, including in symphonic, jazz, and marching band ensembles. I also play piano, and can get by on most percussion and brass instruments. I am currently learning Electric and Bass guitar. <br> Watch my high school COVID digital performance of "How do you do, Miss Pratt?":<br>

                        My first employment as a sound engineer was for BYU-Idaho Broadcast Productions, where I worked in the I-Center, Hart gymnasium/auditorium, and other venues and setups around the school. I now work in Salt Lake City as a venue/sound technician for the Church of Jesus Christ, as well as a stagehand through the IATSE Local 99 union. I recently worked concerts for Earth, Wind, and Fire; Pierce the Veil, and Kesha.

                        Music creation and remixing/covering are hobbies of mine. I primarily use FL Studio, and do all steps of the process myself. My music is distributed by Soundrop. Two of my remixes are available online: <br>
