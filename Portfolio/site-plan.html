        History
My first experiences with coding were with Scratch and Lego Mindstorms EV3 in 6th and 7th grade. In 8th and 9th grade, I began to learn JavaScript in order to make Discord bots and Minecraft plugins.

Family
My mother got her degree in CIT when I was in middle school. One of my brothers graduated from BYU-Idaho as a Software Engineer, and my younger brother is currently in the Computer Engineering program, and leads of the OSDev team.

Check out ThreadMapz, a notes mapping application for the iPad, designed by my father and developed by Benjamin Pratt (one of my brothers).

Current Projects
I am currently working on an anonymous blog, which is hosted on a Raspberry Pi, and was developed while learning the skills in the WDD130 course at BYU-Idaho. It will not be linked here, as it is meant to be anonymous (I am also struggling to get it to stay on the WWW and DNS, though it worked for a little bit at least).

        Music
Music is one of the largest shapers of my life. Listening, composing, playing, performing, and mixing are constants in my life.
Everyone in my family plays at least one instrument. I am a direct descendent of Parley P. Pratt, who wrote several hymns in the LDS hymnal.

Musicianship
I have been a singer my whole life, and I played trombone from 5th grade through high school, including in symphonic, jazz, and marching band ensembles. I also play piano, and can get by on most percussion and brass instruments. I am currently learning Electric and Bass guitar.

Live Sound
My MonitorWorld setup on the BYUI Hart stage
My first employment as a sound engineer was for BYU-Idaho Broadcast Productions, where I worked in the I-Center, Hart gymnasium/auditorium, and other venues and setups around the school. I now work in Salt Lake City as a venue/sound technician for the Church of Jesus Christ, as well as a stagehand through the IATSE Local 99 union. I recently worked concerts for Earth, Wind, and Fire; Pierce the Veil, and Kesha.

Music Production
Music creation and remixing/covering are hobbies of mine. I primarily use FL Studio, and do all steps of the process myself. My music is distributed by Soundrop. Two of my remixes are available online:
