    <h2>Dallin Pratt</h2>
    <p>I am Dallin. I am getting an Associetes degree in Professional Studies, with a minor in Computer Science. </p>
    <p>Right now, I work as an A/V Technician at Temple Square, and freelance/union contractor in SLC.</p>
    <p>The thing I love most about BYU-I are the people in Rexburg.</p>
    <p>I am taking this course because it's one of the last things I have to check off the list before graduating.</p>
    <p>I was born into the church. My Great Great Great Great Great Grandfather is Parley P Pratt.</p>
    <p>One of my favorite quotes is from President Nelson:</p>
    <p>"Anytime you do Anything that helps Anyone - on either side of the veil - take a step toward making covenants with God and </p>
    <p>receiving their essential baptismal and temple ordinances, you are helping to gather Israel. It is as simple as that."</p>
