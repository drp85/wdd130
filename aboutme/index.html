    <h2>Dallin Pratt</h2>
    <p>I am Dallin. I am a Computer Science major. </p>
    <p>I used to be in Electrical Engineering, but I decided to give up on it after failing so many math classes because of the homework.</p>
    <p>Career wise, I want to work in something electronic. Right now, I work as a Live Audio Technician at BYU-I.</p>
    <p>The thing I love most about BYU-I is the people here. People make it easier to stay sane, especially when struggling academically, mentally, or winter-ly.</p>
    <p>I am taking this course because it is required in my major, but I am also finding that it will be very helpful to my potential careers.</p>
    <p>I was born into the church. My Great Great Great Great Great Grandfather is Parley P Pratt.</p>
    <p>One of my favorite quotes is from President Nelson:</p>
    <p>"Anytime you do Anything that helps Anyone - on either side of the veil - take a step toward making covenants with God and receiving their essential baptismal and temple ordinances, you are helping to gather Israel. It is as simple as that."</p>
